# mal-score-for-anilist
Userscript to adds MyAnimeList link and score to AniList anime and manga pages

Though I have shifted to AniList from MAL, there are often times I refer to the MAL score too in deciding whether I want to watch the anime or not. This script adds the MAL score and the link to the MAL page in the sidebar for that particular anime/manga's page.

Note: I have only tested this script in Chrome. You'll need to approve the cross reference request to the myanimelist site the first time. Also, it won't work in firefox since it doesn't support cross-origin requests.
